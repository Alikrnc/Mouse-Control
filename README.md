# Mouse Control with Nose
A Python program that helps to use the mouse with the tip of the nose.

# Introduction:
With this program, you can use the mouse by turning or moving your head (and therefore your nose).
When both eyes are closed, the origin point will be determined as the point where the tip of your nose is.
The mouse will move in the direction of the horizontal or vertical distance of your nose tip to the origin, and it will accelerate as the distance from the origin increases.
Simply close your right eye to right click, and your left eye to left click.
